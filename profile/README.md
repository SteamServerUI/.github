## 🚀 From Stationeers to Steam: The Great Servervolution

Once upon a time, [@JacksonTheMaster](https://github.com/JacksonTheMaster) built **SteamServerUI** (SSUI), a sleek, retro-themed UI to tame the wild beast that a Stationeers dedicated server is. It was glorious—automatic SteamCMD setups, one-click controls, Discord bots, and a backup system smarter than your average space engineer. 

But then, [@mitoskalandiel](https://github.com/mitoskalandiel) dropped a galaxy-sized idea: *Why stop at Stationeers?* Why not make SSUI the ultimate overlord of **any** Steam server? 

And so, the **SteamServerUI Organization** was born, leading the charge to generalize the beautiful chaos of server management across the entire Steam ecosystem.

## 🌟 The Platform Evolution

### 🎯 **SteamServerUI v6** - The Universal Platform
The shiny, in-development evolution designed to run **any** Steam game server that can be wrangled with a `runfile`. From **Satisfactory** to **Project Zomboid**, **Valheim** to **Counter-Strike 2** – if SteamCMD can download it, SteamServerUI can manage it.

**Status:** 🚧 *Active Development*  
**Repository:** [SteamServerUI/SteamServerUI](https://github.com/SteamServerUI/SteamServerUI)

### 🚀 **StationeersUI v5** - The Proven Champion  
The dedicated, battle-tested LTS version, chiseled in time as a rock-solid option for your spacefaring server needs. All the features that made the original legendary, maintained and supported.

**Status:** ✅ *LTS - Long Term Support*  
**Repository:** [SteamServerUI/StationeersServerUI](https://github.com/SteamServerUI/StationeersServerUI)

### 🤖 **Automation First**
- **Zero-config SteamCMD setup**
- **Automatic server updates**
- **Smart backup systems**
- **Discord bot integration**
- **One-click everything**

### 🔒 **Secure By Default**
JWT authentication, TLS encryption, and security best practices baked in from day one.

## How to Prepare
1. **Review the Roadmap**: Familiarize yourself with the timeline above and plan for the Q4-2025 migration.
2. **Stay Connected**: Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8n3vN92MyJ) or GitHub Discussions for updates, support, and tips.

> ⚠️ **v6 Development Notice**: SteamServerUI v6 is currently in active development. It's like a prototype spaceship—cool and functional, but expect some loose bolts. Perfect for testing and development, but we recommend v5 for production Stationeers servers.
