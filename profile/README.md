## 🚀 From Stationeers to Steam: The Great Servervolution

Once upon a time, I built **SteamServerUI** (SSUI), a sleek, retro-themed UI to tame the wild beast that a Stationeers dedicated server is. It is glorious—automatic SteamCMD setups, one-click controls, Discord bots, and a backup system smarter than your average space engineer. But then, @mitoskalandiel dropped a galaxy-sized idea: *Why stop at Stationeers?* Why not make SSUI the ultimate overlord of *any* Steam server? And so, **SteamServerUI** was born, with @JacksonTheMaster leading the charge to generalize the chaos of server management.

**SteamServerUI (v6)** is the shiny, in-development evolution of SSUI, designed to run *any* Steam game server that can be wrangled with a `runfile`. Think Satisfactory, Project Zomboid, Stationeers, or even that obscure indie game you love (as long as you write a `runfile` for it). Meanwhile, Stationeers fans, fear not: **SteamServerUI (v5)** remains a dedicated, maintained LTS version, chizzled in time as a rock-solid option for your spacefaring needs. v6 as **SteamServerUI** is a separate beast, and it won’t mess with v5’s vibe. It will probably be a while before v6 is released, and the details are still being worked out.
I am not sure if SteamServerUI will (should) move to a new repo later, but I will update this readme to reflect that once I know more about where I wanna go with this project and the Stationeers version.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: v6 is a *preview*. It’s like a prototype spaceship—cool, but expect a lot of loose bolts. This is meant for development, not production. Some Stationeers-specific features (like BackupManager and Discord) are currently in a state of… let’s call it “creative flux.” Non-breaking, but they complain with some noise.
